        <p>In contemporary usage the term appears primarily in two contexts: where loins are "girded" in preparation for a challenge, or else euphemistically referring to human genitals.[1][2] In literature or poetry, to feel a "stirring" in one's loins may suggest sexual excitement.

            The word "loincloth" in the Bible, is used to refer to an item of clothing which covers the loins.[12] The "fruit" of one's loins refers to offspring,[13] and "fruit of my loins" also appears in the King James Version.[14]
            
            Loins may refer generally to the lower area of the body,[15] much like the term "below the belt" derives from a belt worn at the waist.[16]
            
            When the long tunic of the Ancient era was the typical garment, the phrase "gird one's loins" described the process of raising and securing the lower portion of the tunic between one's legs to increase mobility for work or battle.[17] In the modern age, it has become an idiom meaning to prepare oneself for action, as in:
            
            If your counselor says your aptitude scores show that you have the ability [ ... ], gird up your loins and start making a valiant try right now.[18]</p>
